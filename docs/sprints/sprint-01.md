how do I open sprint-01.md in the terminal and delete its content and paste this:
# Sprint 1 – Backend Foundation & Basic Auth

## Sprint Goal
Establish a secure, stateless backend foundation with clean architecture and basic authentication flows.

## Planned Sprint Backlog
- Spring Boot application scaffold
- Security configuration
- Authentication foundation

## Completed Work
- Spring Boot app scaffold
- Deterministic Maven build (wrapper)
- Embedded dev database (H2)
- Stateless Spring Security configuration
- User domain (entity + repository)
- Password hashing (BCrypt)
- Register endpoint
- Login endpoint

## Increment
- Backend boots cleanly
- API is secure-by-default
- Users can register and log in
- System is JWT-ready (no token issuance yet)

## Scope Adjustment (Inspection & Adaptation)
Frontend scaffolding and JWT issuance were deferred to Sprint 2
to allow focused backend foundation and reduce rework.

## Notes
Sprint emphasized architectural correctness over feature breadth.
